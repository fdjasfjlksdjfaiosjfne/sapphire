# "Conditional Statements"
This is generally used to refer to these three statements: 
- `if`/`elif`/`else` (classic)
- `match`/`case` (pattern matching)
- `switch`/`case` (jump table)

If specification is needed, it should be referred to as:
- `if`:
  - "If-style conditional statement"
  - "Classic conditional statement"
  - "If statement"
- `match`:
  - "Match-style conditional statement"
  - "Pattern matching conditional statement"
  - "Match statement"
- `switch`:
  - "Switch-style conditional statement"
  - "Switch statement"
# "Angle Brackets"/"Less/Greater Sign"
This refers to `<` and `>`.
Those should only refer to either of these names in the approiate contexts.
Angle Bracket:
```c++
#include <std.io>
```
Less/Greater Sign:
```py
5 < 6
10 > 4
```
